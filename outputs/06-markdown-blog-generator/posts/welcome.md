## About This Blog

This blog is generated from Markdown files using a custom Python script. The generator supports:

- **Frontmatter metadata** for titles, dates, and tags
- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Clean, readable typography**

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Welcome to my blog!")
    return "Thanks for reading!"
```

I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them!
