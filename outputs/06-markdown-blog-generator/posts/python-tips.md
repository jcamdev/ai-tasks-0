# 5 Python Tips for Better Code

Here are some practical Python tips that will help you write cleaner, more efficient code.

## 1. Use List Comprehensions

Instead of writing loops, use list comprehensions for cleaner code:

```python
# Instead of this
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i**2)

# Do this
squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
```

## 2. Use f-strings for String Formatting

F-strings are the most readable way to format strings in Python:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Instead of this
message = "Hello, my name is {} and I'm {} years old".format(name, age)

# Do this
message = f"Hello, my name is {name} and I'm {age} years old"
```

## 3. Use enumerate() Instead of range(len())

When you need both index and value, use enumerate():

```python
items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Instead of this
for i in range(len(items)):
    print(f"{i}: {items[i]}")

# Do this
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    print(f"{i}: {item}")
```

## 4. Use zip() to Iterate Over Multiple Lists

Combine multiple iterables with zip():

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]

for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```

## 5. Use Context Managers for File Operations

Always use `with` statements when working with files:

```python
# This automatically closes the file
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    # File is automatically closed here
```

These tips will help you write more Pythonic code that's easier to read and maintain!
